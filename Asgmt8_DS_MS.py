# Q4. What are getter and setter in python? Create a class and create a getter and a setter method in this
## class.


## Getter - Method that allows you to access an attribute in a given class


## Setter - A method that allows you to set or mutate the value of an attribute 

## If an attribute is likely to change its internal implementation then you should use
# getter and setter methods

# Eg

class chocolatecake:
    def __init__(self, recipe_price, recipe_amount):
        self.__recipe_price = recipe_price
        self.recipe_amount = recipe_amount
        
    @property
    def recipe_price_access(self):
        return self.__recipe_price
    

    # Using set property to allow user to access values on protected / public prop
    
    @recipe_price_access.setter
    def recipe_price_ser(self, price):
        if price <= 50:
            pass
        else: 
            self.__recipe_price = price
            
    @recipe_price_access.deleter
    def recipe_price_del(self):
        del self.__recipe_price


chck = chocolatecake(35 , 1 )
chck.recipe_amount
chck._chocolatecake__recipe_price

# Q5.What is method overriding in python? Write a python code to demonstrate method overriding.

## Method overriding refers to defining a method in a subclass that has the same name as the 
## one in its super class. It allows a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method
## defined in its superclass


# Eg

class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print('Animal speaking!')
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print('Dog barking')
obj = Dog()
obj.speak()


# In[21]:


class Human:
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.age = age

h001 = Human('Abhay', 'Kashyap', 26)
